Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The "Software Crisis" and the Birth of Software Engineering (Late 1960s):

In the late 1960s, the increasing complexity of software projects led to what became known as the "software crisis." Projects were frequently over budget, delayed, and riddled with defects.
This crisis highlighted the need for a more disciplined and systematic approach to software development.
The 1968 and 1969 NATO Software Engineering Conferences were pivotal in recognizing software development as an engineering discipline. This marked the formal beginning of software engineering as a distinct field, with an emphasis on structured methodologies and processes.
This time brought about the understanding that software development needed to move from a "craft" to an "engineering" discipline.

2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s-1990s):

Object-oriented programming (OOP) revolutionized software design by introducing concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
OOP allowed developers to model real-world entities as "objects," making code more modular, reusable, and maintainable.
Languages like C++ and Java gained widespread popularity, facilitating the development of complex software systems.
This paradigm shift allowed for far greater complexity in software design and allowed for better code reusability.

3. The Internet Age and Web Development (1990s-2000s):

The emergence of the internet and the World Wide Web transformed software development into a globally connected endeavor.
Web development became a crucial aspect of software engineering, with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript playing essential roles.
Client-server architecture and web-based applications became prevalent, enabling new forms of communication, e-commerce, and information sharing.
This period drastically increased the scope of software, and created the need for new development models.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning:

It involves identifying requirements, estimating resources, and creating a project plan.
Essentially, this phase sets the foundation for the entire project.

2. Requirements Analysis:
This phase focuses on gathering and documenting detailed user requirements.
It involves understanding what the software needs to do and how it should perform.
The outcome is a clear set of requirements that guide the design and development processes.

3. Design
In this phase, the software's architecture and design are created.
This includes defining the system's structure, user interface, and data flow.
Design documents serve as a blueprint for developers.

4. Implementation (Coding):
This is where the actual coding takes place.
Developers translate the design into functional software using programming languages.
Coding standards and best practices are followed to ensure quality.

5. Testing:
This critical phase involves identifying and fixing defects in the software.
Various testing techniques are used, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
The goal is to ensure the software meets the specified requirements and is reliable.
